# Custom driver for Logitech R400
This driver allows to control the device in three different modes:
- Mouse: controls the mouse using left/right (and up/down by holding the bottom-right button),
- Morse: translates the presses on the bottom-right button as morse code and inputs the corresponding characters,
- Player: basic controls for media player (rewind/forward, play/pause...).

Switching between modes is done by holding both left and right buttons.
